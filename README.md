# rust-lang-learning-examples

This is a collection of toy code examples written while reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), a book that teaches the basics and advanced features of Rust. High recommendation for this book.

Actually I make this repository public here just to record my learning progress.

## How to use this repository

All codes passed test on rustc 1.76.0 (07dca489a 2024-02-04).

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the examples using the `cargo` command. For example, to run the `hello_cargo` example, you can do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/255doesnotexist/rust-lang-learning-examples.git
cd rust-lang-learning-examples/hello_cargo
cargo run
```

~~The hello_world directory need to compile with rustc because it's created before the book introduce the cargo tool.~~
